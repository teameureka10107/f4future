## Story

Hi, Iam Pranav! Thanks for taking interest in my cause. When I was part of an FLL team, I was exposed to teaching new kids. This opened up an opportunity for me to understand myself better and realize that I loved teaching kids, especially those who had not been exposed to robotics before.

Whenever a new member joined the team, I took the responsibility to teach them. Slowly but surely, I started teaching new rookie teams in Austin. I was so passionate about teaching that wherever I traveled, if there was an FLL team, I wanted to meet them and teach.

As I continued to learn new things such as 3D Printing and CAD design, I realized that the best way to share my knowledge was to bring together people of similar interests. So, I worked with my mentor to form a small organization that helped to bring together people and resources. The organization also helped to spread the word about the importance of teaching kids about robotics.

## What do we do?

We help kids from Grade 5 and above to get introduced to STEM, learn about applying concepts they learn in STEM by building fun robots, understand problems in society and create innovative solutions applying same principles.

* FIRST Lego League
* FIRST Tech Competitions
* CAD Design
* 3D Printing
* Computer Science - Coding/Programming



## Mission

We are a small but motivated and enthusiastic team that is committed to educating the young kids in STEAM


Our mission is to empower young minds to become young engineers and visualize the world in new ways. We do this by providing students with the opportunity to design, build, and code LEGO-based robots, create models using CAD software, and learn how to use 3D printing. We are committed to making engineering education accessible to all students, especially those who are underprivileged and lack access to engineering tools.

At Foundation of Future, Future Engineers, our mission is to empower young minds to become the innovators and problem-solvers of tomorrow. We believe in the power of STEAM education to transform the way students view the world and themselves. Through our engaging and hands-on educational approach, we aim to foster creativity, critical thinking, and a passion for learning in young engineers.</p>


## Team

We are a group of dedicated educators, engineers, and enthusiasts who share a common vision: to make STEAM education fun, accessible, and inspiring. Our team brings a diverse set of skills and experiences, united by our commitment to nurturing the potential of every student.
