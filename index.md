We are a small but motivated and enthusiastic team that is committed to educating the young kids in STEAM

## Mission

Our mission is to empower young minds to become young engineers and visualize the world in new ways. We do this by providing students with the opportunity to design, build, and code LEGO-based robots, create models using CAD software, and learn how to use 3D printing. We are committed to making engineering education accessible to all students, especially those who are underprivileged and lack access to engineering tools.
